# syncplaylists

An amarok script that enables you to sync selected playlist an their track-files to local directories.

Just run the script, and the menu item "sync Selected Playlists" 
under "Tools" will appear. Select playlists and the track belonging to them
are copied to two local directories, where the directory structure of
the track-files is preserved.
